# Portfolio — Vishal Chakradhari

This is a single-file portfolio focused on game development, Unreal Engine, C++ programming, 3D art (Blender), environment design, and creative technical work.

Files created:

- `Protfolio2.html` — Main portfolio page (single-page layout). Copyright © Vishal Chakradhari.
- `styles.css` — Site styles (dark theme with neon accents).
- `script.js` — Small interactions: nav toggle, smooth scrolling, gallery lightbox.

Quick start

1. Put your images in `Asset/images` (names referenced in the HTML: `project-1.png`, `project-2.png`, `project-3.png`, `gallery-1.png`, `gallery-2.png`, `gallery-3.png`, `gallery-4.png`).
2. Open `Protfolio2.html` in a browser (double-click or use a local web server).

Notes & next steps

- Replace placeholder name/email/links in `Protfolio2.html` with your real data.
- Add GitHub / live build links for each project card.
- Consider deploying with GitHub Pages or Netlify for a hosted URL.
- Optional: convert to a static site generator (Hugo/Eleventy) or add a small CMS if you plan frequent blog/devlog updates.

Design rationale

The layout is intentionally minimal and focused: a dark background to highlight art and renders, neon accents for a subtle studio / game-tech feel, and clear sections that present technical depth (projects, systems) as well as creative work (gallery, sketches). The tone is confident and skill-driven — suitable for applications, portfolios, and outreach to studios.
